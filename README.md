# Next.js 15 Server Components: Async/Await Loop Data Fetching Issue

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug that can occur in Next.js 15 server components when using `async/await` within loops for data fetching. The problem arises from potential race conditions and inefficient handling of asynchronous operations, leading to unexpected results.

## Problem Description

The core issue lies in the way asynchronous operations are managed inside a loop, specifically within `Promise.all`.  Although using `Promise.all` with `map` and `async/await` seems straightforward, it can lead to silent failures or incomplete data if not handled carefully.

## Solution

The solution involves careful error handling and potentially optimizing the data fetching process to reduce the risk of race conditions.  This may involve adjusting the asynchronous operations, adding more robust error handling, or changing the fetching strategy.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Observe the potential issues in the application.
